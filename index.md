## What is PCSX2-EX?

Simply put: PCSX2-EX is an extended version of PCSX2, with improvements to it's performance and modification abilities.
<br/><br/>

## What is the diference between PCSX2 and PCSX2-EX?

For starters, PCSX2-EX does **not** recieve updates like PCSX2 does. PCSX2-EX is based on one set version depending on the feedback from it's users, for best performance and ease of use.

In addition to those, PCSX2-EX also includes:
- A base EE Address of 0x20000000 on x86 builds, ensuring Cheat Engine and EmuHaste compatibility.
- The lack of an IPC API.
- An extended version of PNACH called ExPATCH which includes pointer operations and timer-based execution.
- A Lua interpreter made specifically for PCSX2-EX called the LuaEngine, based on sol2 to allow advanced modifications.
- Various performance fixes and quality of life improvements.

## Why isn't this a part of the master build of PCSX2?

TL;DR - Drama and incompetence.
